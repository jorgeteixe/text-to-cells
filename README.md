### Problem
A friend has to copy from PDFs to a software to create bills, and the software he uses has cells with max lenght of 256. He also has the problem that while copying from the PDF the format caused problems, so I created this to help him.

An app that converts the text pasted with '\t', '\n' and '-' characters into 256 lenght cells without format.
